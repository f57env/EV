# 📖 About

ChargeHub is an **Enterprise EV Charging Aggregator Platform** designed to connect EV users with charging stations operated by independent shop owners, businesses, apartments, and commercial partners.

The platform works similarly to **BookMyShow**, but instead of booking movie tickets, users discover nearby charging stations, reserve charging slots, complete charging sessions, and make secure digital payments.

This project is being developed as a **production-style enterprise Java application**, beginning as an Advanced Java Console Application using **JDBC + MySQL**, and later evolving into a complete Spring Boot + React ecosystem.

---

# 🎯 Vision

To build India's largest decentralized EV charging ecosystem by empowering local businesses to become charging partners while providing EV users with a seamless charging experience.

---

# 🚀 Project Objectives

- Build a scalable EV Charging Aggregator
- Demonstrate Enterprise Java Development
- Implement Industry Standard Architecture
- Practice Advanced Java Concepts
- Prepare for Spring Boot Migration
- Showcase Production-Level Software Engineering
